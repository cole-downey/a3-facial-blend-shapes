# Animation P3 - Blend Shape Facial Animation

In this project, I took an input of a face mesh and a set of defined facial action units, and implemented blend shape animation. I combined settings of different facial action units to create multiple blend shapes, then interpolated through them on the GPU using a GLSL shader. Created in C++ using OpenGL and Maya.

To use after building:
./A3 ../resources ../data
